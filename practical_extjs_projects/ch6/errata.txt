On page 352, referring to the listing of the file Details.js, the configuration for the 
Panel with the ID "MapPane" now has the forceLayout:true option added to it in order 
for the map to display the first time.

On page 356-357, the call to the load() method was changed to doRequest() since load() 
is now deprecated.  Also, doRequest() has two arguments before the parameters object. 
The first is the method, "read" in this case, and the second is unusused, so null is passed.
