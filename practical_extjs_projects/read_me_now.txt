Hello dear reader,

What you have here is the source code bundle for the book
"Practical Ext JS Projects with Gears" by Frank W. Zammetti, published by
Apress in 2009.

Each of the nine chapters of the book has a corresponding directory here.
Within each is a code directory, which is of course what you're interested in!
The first two chapters have a bunch of small examples while the remaining
seven are complete applications.  There is also a directory ext, which is
Ext JS v3 final.

Also within some of the directories is a file called errata.txt.  This file
will contain any changes in the code from what is in the book resulting from
upgrading to Ext v3 final (much of the book was written against v3 pre-release
code and there were breaking changes when v3 final was released).  The changes
are all relatively minor, but you'll want to review those errats.txt files
before reading the book.

One general errata: the paths in the <script> tags in all of the projects was
changed to allow all of the code to share the same copy of ext.  This was done
to make this source code bundle smaller.  Hopefully you appreciate what I do
for you! :)

Thanks for reading my book and have a fund time with it!

-Frank W. Zammetti
